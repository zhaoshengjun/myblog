Recently I created my first open source NPM package calledÂ `create-webpack-config`. As you can guess, this is to create aÂ [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)Â configuration file (`webpack.config.js`), via CLI.

Basically itâ€™s a command line tool which will generate an app structure for you to start usingÂ [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)Â in no time.

As to today, this module has been downloaded less than 300 times. Itâ€™s a very small number, but for me itâ€™s quite big!

If you like to useÂ [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)Â , try this tool. If you like the tool, star it onÂ [github](https://github.com/zhaoshengjun/webpack-config). It really motivates me!

## How to use

1. Install the package viaÂ `npm i -g create-webpack-config`
2. Create app by runÂ `webpack-config init`

You now have a working directory to start! You can runÂ `npm i`Â to install dependencies and then rurnÂ `npm start`Â to start ðŸš€ !

## Why?

Lots of people cannot figure out how to makeÂ [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)Â work. But some people are also working on this to make it easier to use, with different approaches:

- boilerplate
- better documents(especially @TheLarkInn, @sokra and other team members)
- â€¦ â€¦

With the popularize of Create-React-App (CRA), I think itâ€™s worth another shot by building a CLI tools to provide single command to get started with webpack.

After all, webpack is a GREAT tool and we all love it ðŸ’• ðŸ’• ðŸ’• !
